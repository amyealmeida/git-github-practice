## Follow the directions below:

- __check__: open your terminal - where are you on your computer? make sure you're in your 'root' folder ('Users/jasonnappy')

- clone this repository to your local machine

- __check__: can you `cd` into the repo on your machine?

- `cd` into the repo once it's on your machine and create a new branch with your name, like `name-work`

- __check__: now, when you type in `git branch` are you on `master` or on your new branch?

- then open in sublime
- follow the directions in `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` and refresh the page as you make changes to test your code

- __check__: did you open the files and see the correct tabs - `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` - in sublime?

- commit your changes and push those changes back a new branch, named accordingly, on GitHub

- __check__: did you save first? did you enter the correct `git` commands?

- create a pull request!

Remember, Google is your friend!  

The `index.html` page should behave like this when you click the button:
